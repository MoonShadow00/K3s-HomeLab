# Kubernetes HomeLab

## Overview

This repository documents my Kubernetes HomeLab environment built with K3s. The lab is designed for hands-on learning, testing, automation, networking, observability, and security engineering projects.

The environment focuses on:

* Kubernetes administration
* Infrastructure automation
* VLAN-aware networking
* Load balancing with MetalLB
* Containerized workloads
* Security engineering experimentation
* CI/CD and GitOps workflows
* Monitoring and observability

# HomeLab Goals

The purpose of this HomeLab is to:

* Develop production-aligned Kubernetes skills
* Build practical Security Engineering experience
* Experiment with networking and segmentation concepts
* Learn infrastructure automation and orchestration
* Simulate enterprise-style environments at small scale
* Host self-managed services and internal tooling
* Create portfolio projects for career growth

# Networking

## Network Design

The HomeLab uses VLAN segmentation to separate management traffic, workloads, and services.

### VLAN Layout

| VLAN    | Purpose                     |
| ------- | --------------------------- |
| VLAN 10 | Management                  |
| VLAN 20 | Kubernetes Services         |
| VLAN 30 | Storage / Internal Services |

## Load Balancing

MetalLB is configured in Layer 2 mode to provide external IPs to Kubernetes services running on bare-metal infrastructure.

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: production-pool
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
    - 10.10.20.100-10.10.20.120
```
