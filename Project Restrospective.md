# Project Retrospective

## What Worked

- Successful multi-node K3s deployment
- VLAN segmentation implemented
- MetalLB deployment completed
- Git-based infrastructure management established
- Core Kubernetes services operational

## Challenges Encountered

- Networking architecture became overly complex
- VLAN and MetalLB interactions created troubleshooting challenges
- Service exposure requirements were not clearly defined before implementation
- Time spent troubleshooting outweighed learning value

## Key Lessons Learned

- Start with the simplest networking model possible
- Validate requirements before introducing additional complexity
- Document network design before deployment
- Separate learning objectives from production-style requirements
- Build incrementally and validate each layer before proceeding

## Reason for Project Closure

The project was intentionally closed before full completion in order to redesign the environment from first principles.

The objective was not to create a perfect cluster, but to gain practical Kubernetes and infrastructure experience. The lessons learned from Version 1 directly informed the design of Version 2.
